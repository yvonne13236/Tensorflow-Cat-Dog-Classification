# Tensorflow-Cat-Dog-Classification
A machine learning model to classify dogs and cats images using Tensorflow


Steps:
1. Use Keras's ImageDataGenerator to convert rgb images into array of number, specifiy batch size, specify class mode.

2. Preparing layers in CNN
3.train model
4. get accuracy 
5. test model


*
One epocch: one forward pass and one backward pass of al the training examples
batch size: the number of training examples in one forward/backward pass.
steps per epoch: num_samples/batch_size
